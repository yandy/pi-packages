/**
 * Cross-extension service accessor backed by `Symbol.for()` on `globalThis`.
 *
 * `Symbol.for()` is process-global by spec, so it survives jiti's per-extension
 * module isolation (`moduleCache: false`). A consumer doing
 * `import("@yandy0725/pi-permission-system")` gets a fresh module copy, but
 * `getPermissionsService()` reads from the same `globalThis` slot the provider
 * wrote to — enabling direct, synchronous, type-safe function calls.
 *
 * Best practice: call `getPermissionsService()` per use rather than caching the
 * reference — this ensures resilience across `/reload` and load-order edge cases.
