/**
 * Metamorphic totality property for the bash command gate (#452, A3).
 *
 * Wrapping any `ask`/`deny` command in `cd /x && <cmd>` must not weaken the
 * decision — the chain decomposition + most-restrictive-wins, combined with the
 * fail-closed empty-parse fallback, guarantees a `cd …` prefix can never let a
 * gated command ride a permissive top-level `*`.
 *
 * A focused parametrized table over the real tree-sitter parse + resolve, not a
 * full fuzzer (tree-sitter fuzzing is brittle); it pins A3 directly.
